#Intervals -- a programming language for describing music

Intervals is programming language for describing music written in Python that builds on the Mingus library and FluidSynth synthesizer. Intervals gives the composer access to native musical data types, means of combing these datatypes, and a sound-capable REPL, so as to provide a programming enviro made for music.

A diagram describes the evaluation process:
Intervals composition -> Mingus Python objects -> Midi -> Sound (FluidSynth)

This is very much a work in progress. More complete documentation to come.
